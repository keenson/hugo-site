## Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Olalekan Samson Fadele, a DevOps and cloud enthusiast with a focus on infrastructure & automation. I have hands-on experience in AWS, software containerization platforms like Docker, and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

My journey started like most self-taught from a non-tech background when I joined a startup. Previously I worked as a manager for a marketing and branding company.
I soon realized I had a lot to learn, I was assigned manual testing and some other easy task. So once I started working on these projects, I realized I really loved working on them.

I leveraged recommended resources that I could find and with the help of my colleagues and boss at the time, I was able to learn enough to get started. I have been enjoying learning and growing through this journey.
