## Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Olalekan Samson Fadele, a DevOps and cloud enthusiast with a focus on infrastructure & automation. I have hands-on experience in AWS, software containerization platforms like Docker, and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

My journey started like most self-taught from a non-tech background when I joined a startup after my previous where I worked as a manager for a marketing and branding company.
I soon realized I had a lot to learn, I was assigned manual testing and some other minor tasks. So once I started working on these projects, I realized I really enjoyed learning and growing through this journey.

This blog will serve as documentation of my tech journey. I will be posting about tools and concepts that I encounter,
and the difficulties and solutions I used to solve them. A reference point for the future.
